### ‚òùÔ∏è A brief introduction 

Education as we know it today has not undergone significant changes compared to what it
was like 100 years ago. However, in recent decades, due to recent technological innovation, it has
had to adapt to meet the new needs of users.

Nevertheless, the model used by teachers has not changed, and a traditional scheme is still
applied where the subjects of the course are the most important, and the teacher is not too concerned
about whether the student develops other cognitive, metacognitive, and emotional abilities linked to
self-regulated learning.

This concept is not a generic or general term but a rather sophisticated construct that has
been established in the field of educational research, with the main objective being to develop skills
that enable students to become independent and efficient learners throughout their lives. To achieve
this, students must set learning goals, plan and organize their time, use effective learning strategies,
monitor their progress, regulate their motivation, and evaluate their own learning.

**Studia** was born from the idea of wanting to implement this self-regulated learning to university
students in a simple way, attempting to improve the current Moodle system and innovate the
educational system being taught. Therefore, in this document, I will explain the development of a web
application in collaboration with the Faculty of Education, based on the study found in the article "How
to Embed SRL in Online Learning Settings? Design Through Learning Analytics and Personalized
Learning Design in Moodle" and the project "E-Learning Platform for Self-regulated Learning"
carried out by Elena Cano Garc√≠a, which has been present throughout the development of this
project.
