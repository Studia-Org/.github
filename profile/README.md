### ☝️ A brief introduction 

**Studia** was born from the idea of wanting to implement a self-regulated learning system to university
students in a simple way, attempting to improve the current Moodle system and innovate the
educational system being taught. Therefore, in collaboration with the Faculty of Education in University of Barcelona, Studia is based on the study found in the article "How
to Embed SRL in Online Learning Settings? Design Through Learning Analytics and Personalized
Learning Design in Moodle" and the project "E-Learning Platform for Self-regulated Learning"
carried out by Elena Cano García, which has been present throughout the development of this
project.
